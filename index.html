    <p>
      The <strong>Fabergé Eggs</strong> are a collection of exquisite jeweled
      eggs originally crafted by <strong>Peter Carl Fabergé</strong> for the
      Russian Imperial family. The first egg was commissioned in 1885 by
      <strong>Tsar Alexander III</strong> as an Easter gift for his wife,
      Empress Maria Feodorovna. These eggs became a symbol of luxury, featuring
      intricate designs and hidden surprises. Today, they are considered
      priceless artifacts of craftsmanship and artistry.
